                        management practices and segregation at source through a participatory process within the Worli Koliwada community. The aim of this program is to build a zero waste neighborhood with self-sustainable zones that are equipped to manage solid
                        waste they generate with a model where community participation will be a key at every stage, thereby ensuring sustainability of this program in the long run.</p>
